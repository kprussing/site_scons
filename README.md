Personalize `site_scons`
========================

Just a little place to collect my customizations for running [SCons].  I
hope to flesh out some of these into more proper tools which will then
be useful for others.

Installation
------------

The basic installation is to simply 

    $ git clone git@github.com/kprussing3/site_scons $HOME/.site_scons

and it should work system wide.  Alternatively, you can install as a
`submodule` in a paper repository

    $ git submodule git@github.com/kprussing3/site_scons site_scons

[SCons]: http://www.scons.org
